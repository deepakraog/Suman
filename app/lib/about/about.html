         <p class="headAbout">AngularJS 1.6 with ES6</p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Why ES6?</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            AngularJS version 1.6 with ES5 is the most stable version for production among all. Around 2 years back
            Angular was the daddy of all JS frameworks. It has to see a downfall because of the introduction of ES6. ES6 is
            nothing but the standard of writing javascript. What we are using currently is ES5 on which most of us are familiar
            with. There is an assosiation in Europe called ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) wanted
            to intoduce oops concepts in Javascript and the result is ES6. Currently our browsers are not equipped to
            understand and run the code written using ES6 syntax so we need a transpiler to convert ES6 code to
            corresponding ES5 code and feed it to browsers. Babel is the famous one among the current transpilers. In
            future these transpilers will go off as our browers get equipped to run the ES6 code. Browsers will continue to
            evolve and adopt features in parts. Best to start supporting things now. S0 angular team decided to support
            coders to write code with ES6 syntax and this is how it evolved.

         <p class="subHeadAbout">SPA through routing</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            AngularJS allows you to create Single Page Applications which in turn greatly increases the performance of
            your application. Let's see what is SPA, In our normal/conventional application if you want to switch from one
            view to other the whole page has to be re-rendered and that call to the server is very heavy which put load on
            server which results the slow response. If you make a request what you will get as a response is a whole new
            HTML/JSP page which includes images, corresponding css and js ﬁles which is a heavy process. On the other
            hand, In Single Page Applications if you make a request to switch between the views what you will get as a
            response is just a template in the form of JSON data and it is very lite process exactly like AJAX calls. This can
            be achieved through Routing. Routing is noting but configuration.

         <p class="subHeadAbout">2-way data binding</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            AngularJS is famous among the JS framewoks because of it's 2-way data binding feature. It made very ﬂexible
            to work with large data passing data from fontend to backend. There is a concept called $scope which acts as
            a glue for application data. Using $scope whatever the data you change in the frontend will reﬂect in the JS ﬁle
            and Viceversa.

         <p class="subHeadAbout">Directives</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            Directive is one of the powerfull tool of AngularJS. If you have a repeated code in your application you can put
            that code in a directive and call that within a single line of code. Ex: if I have 7-8 tables in my application,
            Rather than writing table,thead,tbody,tr,th,td tags everytime what I can do is make that table as a directive and use
            that directive within a single line where ever it is necessary by passing the data from the controller. This concept
            is called Component in Angular2 and React18.
         </p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Services/Factories</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            If you have a common business logic for your application then you can put that logic in Service/Factory and
            use that logic from the controller whereever it is necessary.|t's been too often that you will be hearing a big
            question, What is the difference between a foctory and a service? As per my experience there is only a
            difference in Syntax other than that everything remains same. You can accomplish a task and get the same
            result by using Service as well as Factory. Only Angular GOD can tell us the exact difference.

         <p class="headAbout">HTML 5</p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Intro</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            After HTML 4.01 was released, focus shifted to XHTML and its stricter standards. After HTML 4.01 was released,
            focus shifted to XHTML and its stricter standards. HTML5 is much more tolerant and can handle markup from
            all the prior versions.Though HTMLS was published. officially in 2012, it has been in development since 2004.
         </p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Goals of HTML5</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
         <ul style="margin-left:20px;" class="contentAbout">
            <li>Support all existing web pages. With HTML%, there is no requirement to go back and revise older websites.</li>
            <li>Reduce the need for external plugins and scripts to show website content.</li>
            <li>Improve the semantic deﬁnition (i.e. meaning and purpose) of page elements.</li>
            <li>Make the rendering of web content universal and independent of the device being used.</li>
            <li>Handle web documents errors in a better and more consistent fashion.</li>

         <p class="headAbout">SASS</p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Intro</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) is a CSS pre-processor, which helps to reduce repetition with CSS and
            saves time. It is more stable and powerful CSS extension language that describes the style of document
            structurally. This tutorial covers the basics of SASS.
         </p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Advantages</p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">
         <ul style="margin-left:20px;" class="contentAbout">
            <li>It allows writing clean CSS in a programming construct. It helps in writing CSS quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a superset of CSS, which helps designers and developers work more efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li>As Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS, we can use any available CSS libraries.</li>
            <li>It is possible to use nested syntax and useful functions such as color manipulation, mathematics and other
               values.

         <p class="subHeadAbout">Features of SASS</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            It is more stable, powerful, and compatible with versions of CSS. It is a super set of CSS and is based on
            JavaScript. It is known as syntactic sugar for CSS, which means it makes easier way for user to read or express
            the things more clearly. It uses its own syntax and compiles to readable CSS. You can easily write CSS in less
            code within less time. It is an open source pre-processor, which is interpreted into CSS.

         <p class="headAbout">Webpack</p>
         <p class="subHeadAbout">Intro</p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            The Webpack conﬁg ﬁle, often named webpack.conﬁg.js, is just a JS ﬁle which gets executed inside Node.js. It
            has to export a conﬁguration object. What this means ﬁrst and foremost is, that you can basically use all your
            Node modules in it and write JavaScript as you are used to. This gives you much ﬂexibility for the creation of
            the conﬁg object.
         </p>
         <p class="contentAbout">
            First you import the modules you need for the creation of the conﬁg object. Import the Node path
            module and the Webpack HTML plugin. Next you write the things that need to be done before the conﬁg object
            can be created. You can do this in-line if you like, ljust prefer it like this. Often you have many plugins and
            this can get unwieldy, if they're all created inline.
